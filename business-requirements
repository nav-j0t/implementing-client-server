You have met with Norman Geekly (CIO) and Billy Kidd (Sr. Manager, IT) and identified the requirements for the client/server environment.
Implementation Environment: You will utilize Oracle’s VirtualBox hypervisor as the main platform for this project.

Host-Only Network: You will set up Host-Only Network in VirtualBox with an IPV4 network address of 192.168.1.1/24 and an IPV4 network mask of 255.255.255.0. Please make sure the VirtualBox DHCP server is disabled as you will be installing the DHCP role on one of the server VMs.

Domain: Fitter Snacker has registered the domain fittersnacker.com. You will use corp.fittersnacker.com in your environment when setting up AD DS and DNS. Use FITTER as the NetBIOS domain name.

Servers: You will implement two virtual servers from scratch (don’t reuse the ones from previous labs/assignments) using Windows Server 2012 R2 with the following specifications:

1. server VM#1:

    • Name: fsserver1
    • OS: Windows Server 2012 R2, Full GUI
    • Memory: 1536 MB (min 1024 MB))
    • Disk: 30 GB
    • Static IP Address: 192.168.1.5
    • Roles:
    • Directory Server (AD DS)
    • DNS server
    • File server
    • Web Server
    
2. server VM#2:

    • Name: fsserver2
    • OS: Windows Server 2012 R2, Full GUI
    • Memory: 1536 MB (min 1024 MB)
    • Disk: 30 GB
    • Static IP Address: 192.168.1.6
    • Roles:
    • DHCP server
    • File server
    • Print server
    
Clients – Although Fitter Snacker will have many client computers, you will implement one virtual client from scratch (don’t reuse the one from previous labs/assignments) using Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 7 32-bit with the following specifications:

    • Name: fsclient1
    • OS: Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 7 32-bit
    • Memory: 768 MB (min 512 MB)
    • Disk: 20 GB
    • IP Address: Automatically assigned by DHCP server
